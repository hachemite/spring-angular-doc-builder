Calls to `animate` are expected\n * to be used within {\\@link sequence an animation sequence}, {\\@link group group}, or {\\@link\n * transition transition}.\n *\n * ### Usage\n *\n * The `animate` function accepts two input parameters: `timing` and `styles`:\n *\n * - `timing` is a string based value that can be a combination of a duration with optional delay\n * and easing values. The format for the expression breaks down to `duration delay easing`\n * (therefore a value such as `1s 100ms ease-out` will be parse itself into `duration=1000,\n * delay=100, easing=ease-out`. If a numeric value is provided then that will be used as the\n * `duration` value in millisecond form.\n * - `styles` is the style input data which can either be a call to {\\@link style style} or {\\@link\n * keyframes keyframes}. If left empty then the styles from the destination state will be collected\n * and used (this is useful when describing an animation step that will complete an animation by\n * {\\@link transition#the-final-animate-call animating to the final state}).\n *\n * ```typescript\n * // various functions for specifying timing data\n * animate(500, style(...))\n * animate(\"1s\", style(...))\n * animate(\"100ms 0.5s\", style(...))\n * animate(\"5s ease\", style(...))\n * animate(\"5s 10ms cubic-bezier(.17,.67,.88,.1)\", style(...))\n *\n * // either style() of keyframes() can be used\n * animate(500, style({ background: \"red\" }))\n * animate(500, keyframes([\n *   style({ background: \"blue\" })),\n *   style({ background: \"red\" }))\n * ])\n * ```\n *\n * {\\@example core/animation/ts/dsl/animation_example.ts region='Component'}\n *\n * \\@experimental Animation support is experimental.\n * @param {?} timings\n * @param {?=} styles\n * @return {?}\n */\nfunction animate(timings, styles) {\n    if (styles === void 0) { styles = null; }\n    return { type: 4 /* Animate */, styles: styles, timings: timings };\n}\n/**\n * `group` is an animation-specific function that is designed to be used inside of Angular's\n * animation DSL language.

If this information is new, please navigate to the {\\@link\n * Component#animations-anchor component animations metadata page} to gain a better understanding of\n * how animations in Angular are used.\n *\n * `state` declares an animation state within the given trigger. When a state is active within a\n * component then its associated styles will persist on the element that the trigger is attached to\n * (even when the animation ends).\n *\n * To animate between states, have a look at the animation {\\@link transition transition} DSL\n * function. To register states to an animation trigger please have a look at the {\\@link trigger\n * trigger} function.\n *\n * #### The `void` state\n *\n * The `void` state value is a reserved word that angular uses to determine when the element is not\n * apart of the application anymore (e.g. when an `ngIf` evaluates to false then the state of the\n * associated element is void).\n *\n * #### The `*` (default) state\n *\n * The `*` state (when styled) is a fallback state that will be used if the state that is being\n * animated is not declared within the trigger.\n *\n * ### Usage\n *\n * `state` will declare an animation state with its associated styles\n * within the given trigger.\n *\n * - `stateNameExpr` can be one or more state names separated by commas.\n * - `styles` refers to the {\\@link style styling data} that will be persisted on the element once\n * the state has been reached.\n *\n * ```typescript\n * // \"void\" is a reserved name for a state and is used to represent\n * // the state in which an element is detached from from the application.\n * state(\"void\", style({ height: 0 }))\n *\n * // user-defined states\n * state(\"closed\", style({ height: 0 }))\n * state(\"open, visible\", style({ height: \"*\" }))\n * ```\n *\n * {\\@example core/animation/ts/dsl/animation_example.ts region='Component'}\n *\n * \\@experimental Animation support is experimental.\n * @param {?} name\n * @param {?} styles\n * @return {?}\n */\nfunction state(name, styles) {\n    return { type: 0 /* State */, name: name, styles: styles };\n}\n/**\n * `keyframes` is an animation-specific function that is designed to be used inside of Angular's\n * animation DSL language.

Instead of applying animations from where they are currently to their\n * destination, keyframes can describe how each style entry is applied and at what point within the\n * animation arc (much like CSS Keyframe Animations do).\n *\n * For each `style()` entry an `offset` value can be set. Doing so allows to specifiy at what\n * percentage of the animate time the styles will be applied.\n *\n * ```typescript\n * // the provided offset values describe when each backgroundColor value is applied.\n * animate(\"5s\", keyframes([\n *   style({ backgroundColor: \"red\", offset: 0 }),\n *   style({ backgroundColor: \"blue\", offset: 0.2 }),\n *   style({ backgroundColor: \"orange\", offset: 0.3 }),\n *   style({ backgroundColor: \"black\", offset: 1 })\n * ]))\n * ```\n *\n * Alternatively, if there are no `offset` values used within the style entries then the offsets\n * will be calculated automatically.\n *\n * ```typescript\n * animate(\"5s\", keyframes([\n *   style({ backgroundColor: \"red\" }) // offset = 0\n *   style({ backgroundColor: \"blue\" }) // offset = 0.33\n *   style({ backgroundColor: \"orange\" }) // offset = 0.66\n *   style({ backgroundColor: \"black\" }) // offset = 1\n * ]))\n * ```\n *\n * {\\@example core/animation/ts/dsl/animation_example.ts region='Component'}\n *\n * \\@experimental Animation support is experimental.\n * @param {?} steps\n * @return {?}\n */\nfunction keyframes(steps) {\n    return { type: 5 /* KeyframeSequence */, steps: steps };\n}\n/**\n * `transition` is an animation-specific function that is designed to be used inside of Angular's\n * animation DSL language. If this information is new, please navigate to the {\\@link\n * Component#animations-anchor component animations metadata page} to gain a better understanding of\n * how animations in Angular are used.\n *\n * `transition` declares the {\\@link sequence sequence of animation steps} that will be run when the\n * provided `stateChangeExpr` value is satisfied. The `stateChangeExpr` consists of a `state1 =>\n * state2` which consists of two known states (use an asterix (`*`) to refer to a dynamic starting\n * and/or ending state).\n *\n * A function can also be provided as the `stateChangeExpr` argument for a transition and this\n * function will be executed each time a state change occurs. If the value returned within the\n * function is true then the associated animation will be run.\n *\n * Animation transitions are placed within an {\\@link trigger animation trigger}. For an transition\n * to animate to a state value and persist its styles then one or more {\\@link state animation\n * states} is expected to be defined.\n *\n * ### Usage\n *\n * An animation transition is kicked off the `stateChangeExpr` predicate evaluates to true based on\n * what the previous state is and what the current state has become. In other words, if a transition\n * is defined that matches the old/current state criteria then the associated animation will be\n * triggered.\n *\n * ```typescript\n * // all transition/state changes are defined within an animation trigger\n * trigger(\"myAnimationTrigger\", [\n *   // if a state is defined then its styles will be persisted when the\n *   // animation has fully completed itself\n *   state(\"on\", style({ background: \"green\" })),\n *   state(\"off\", style({ background: \"grey\" })),\n *\n *   // a transition animation that will be kicked off when the state value\n *   // bound to \"myAnimationTrigger\" changes from \"on\" to \"off\"\n *   transition(\"on => off\", animate(500)),\n *\n *   // it is also possible to do run the same animation for both directions\n *   transition(\"on <=> off\", animate(500)),\n *\n *   // or to define multiple states pairs separated by commas\n *   transition(\"on => off, off => void\", animate(500)),\n *\n *   // this is a catch-all state change for when an element is inserted into\n *   // the page and the destination state is unknown\n *   transition(\"void => *\", [\n *     style({ opacity: 0 }),\n *     animate(500)\n *   ]),\n *\n *   // this will capture a state change between any states\n *   transition(\"* => *\", animate(\"1s 0s\")),\n *\n *   // you can also go full out and include a function\n *   transition((fromState, toState) => {\n *     // when `true` then it will allow the animation below to be invoked\n *     return fromState == \"off\" && toState == \"on\";\n *   }, animate(\"1s 0s\"))\n * ])\n * ```\n *\n * The template associated with this component will make use of the `myAnimationTrigger` animation\n * trigger by binding to an element within its template code.\n *\n * ```html\n * <!-- somewhere inside of my-component-tpl.html -->\n * <div [\\@myAnimationTrigger]=\"myStatusExp\">...</div>\n * ```\n *\n * #### The final `animate` call\n *\n * If the final step within the transition steps is a call to `animate()` that **only** uses a\n * timing value with **no style data** then it will be automatically used as the final animation arc\n * for the element to animate itself to the final state. This involves an automatic mix of\n * adding/removing CSS styles so that the element will be in the exact state it should be for the\n * applied state to be presented correctly.\n *\n * ```\n * // start off by hiding the element, but make sure that it animates properly to whatever state\n * // is currently active for \"myAnimationTrigger\"\n * transition(\"void => *\", [\n *   style({ opacity: 0 }),\n *   animate(500)\n * ])\n * ```\n *\n * ### Transition Aliases (`:enter` and `:leave`)\n *\n * Given that enter (insertion) and leave (removal) animations are so common, the `transition`\n * function accepts both `:enter` and `:leave` values which are aliases for the `void => *` and `*\n * => void` state changes.\n *\n * ```\n * transition(\":enter\", [\n *   style({ opacity: 0 }),\n *   animate(500, style({ opacity: 1 }))\n * ])\n * transition(\":leave\", [\n *   animate(500, style({ opacity: 0 }))\n * ])\n * ```\n *\n * {\\@example core/animation/ts/dsl/animation_example.ts region='Component'}\n *\n * \\@experimental Animation support is experimental.\n * @param {?} stateChangeExpr\n * @param {?} steps\n * @return {?}\n */\nfunction transition(stateChangeExpr, steps) {\n    return { type: 1 /* Transition */, expr: stateChangeExpr, animation: steps };\n}\n/**\n * @license\n * Copyright Google Inc.
